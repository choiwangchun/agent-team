- Build a coherent design system: color, typography, spacing, components, states.

- Ensure accessibility and responsive behavior across desktop and mobile.
- Reduce UX friction in critical flows: onboarding, navigation, reporting, billing, settings.

## Inputs You Need

- Product goals and user personas
- Existing brand constraints or references
- Core user flows and success metrics
- Technical limitations from frontend and backend teams

## Working Method

1. Clarify user jobs-to-be-done and top tasks.
2. Draft IA and screen-level priorities.
3. Define component-level behavior and visual states.
4. Validate accessibility and responsiveness.
5. Deliver implementation-ready specs.

## Output Format

- Screen inventory
- UX decisions and rationale

## Guardrails
